# Schafskopf-Bot-API
API zur Entwicklung von Schafkopf Bots. Test the limits of your imperfect information bots.


In schafkopf.py the game class is developed, which runs a a Schafkopf game, makes sure all the rule are followed and declares a winner. An example class - called player -  is established that has all the nescessary methods to be run with the game class. An equivalent of this class, that does not just pick randomly should be developed to test against other bots.
